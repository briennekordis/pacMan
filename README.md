## Decription
This project allows the user to create not just a pacMan, but pacMen! As the pacMen are created they begin to bounce across the screen. 

## Instructions for Use
1. Downlaod or clone all the files in this repository. Make sure that all of the files are saved in the same location on your local machine. 
2. Load the HTML file on your browser, either by dragging and dropping the file into a browser or right clicking on the file to specify where to open it.
3. Two buttons will apprear once the index.html file is loaded. The button labled "create a pacMan" will add another pacMan to the screen. 
4. The button labled "play game" then initaites the pacMen to start moving on the screen. 

## Roadmap for Improvements
Currently, this project uses images of pacman to produce the visuals for the game. A future improvment could be to use CSS to make pacMen and then either randomize or allow the user to choose different colors for the pacMen in the game.
